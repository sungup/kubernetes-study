Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

  export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join k8s.sungup.io:16443 --token 1fq5r6.8t6qfwqipoth9a6n \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:a9d712e429332dcc207d98b050ae0919663bb3bc42676f86d0731f524718c555 \
        --control-plane --certificate-key 65ba8139d1c3cf0be0e840a6b95fe1ef0de21f2cd9e5f144be3bafa20a3e277c

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join k8s.sungup.io:16443 --token 1fq5r6.8t6qfwqipoth9a6n \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:a9d712e429332dcc207d98b050ae0919663bb3bc42676f86d0731f524718c555

$ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
$ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
$ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

## Add other control-plane node

```bash
$ sudo kubeadm join k8s.sungup.io:16443 --token 1fq5r6.8t6qfwqipoth9a6n \

[mark-control-plane] Marking the node k8s-master-02.sungup.io as control-plane by adding the taints [node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule]

This node has joined the cluster and a new control plane instance was created:

* Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and approval was received.
* The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.
* Control plane (master) label and taint were applied to the new node.
* The Kubernetes control plane instances scaled up.
* A new etcd member was added to the local/stacked etcd cluster.

To start administering your cluster from this node, you need to run the following as a regular user:

        mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
        sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
        sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Run 'kubectl get nodes' to see this node join the cluster.

$ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
$ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
$ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

## Add worker nodes

```bash
$ kubeadm join k8s.sungup.io:16443 --token 1fq5r6.8t6qfwqipoth9a6n \
